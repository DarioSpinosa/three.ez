# Introduction

`three.ez` is a `TypeScript` library designed to simplify and enhance the development of `three.js` applications. <br />
It provides a full suite of easy-to-use tools and high-performance features, making it accessible even to beginners. <br />
With `three.ez`, you will discover an efficient and powerful toolkit for your 3D projects.

The only dependency of this library is `three.js r151+`.

## Features

### Automatic Resize Handling
Automatically resizes `Renderer`, `Camera`, `EffectComposer`. <br />
Using the `rendererResize` event, you can easily set the resolution for custom shaders.

### Smart Rendering
Optimize performance by rendering frames only when necessary, reducing computational load.

### Simplified Multiple Rendering
Easily handle rendering for multiple scenes or viewports on a single canvas.

### Object3D Property Binding
Simplify `Object3D` property management.

### Event Programming
Add interactions to `Object3D` through programmable events, similar to `DOM events`. <br />
It is possible to bind events on changing position, scale, rotation, visibility and enabled state.

### Focus and Blur
Enhance interactivity with focus and blur events.

### Drag and Drop
Seamlessly integrate drag and drop functionality.

### Hitbox Functionality
Utilize hitboxes for customized intersections or simplified calculations.

### Raycasting Options
Choose between continuous or mouse movement-based raycasting, optimizing intersection operations.

### Tweening
Create smooth animations effortlessly with built-in tweening.

### Simplified InstancedMesh
Manage `InstancedMesh` instances as if they were `Object3D`, simplifying creation and manipulation.
